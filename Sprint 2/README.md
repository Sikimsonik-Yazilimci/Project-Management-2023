Sprint 2 was focused on developing the main components of the program. These included accepting parameter inputs, and displaying graph the projectile motion graph.

The visual presentation of the graph was the component that was trialed. Multiple approaches were constructed and presented to the testers. Feedback was collected on the aesthetics and functionality of approaches, with them choosing a final option they would prefer to be implemented in the program.

The program was tested thoroughly to ensure that it is robust.
