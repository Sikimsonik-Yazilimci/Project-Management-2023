# Project-Management-2023


This is the repository of a project aimed at developing a projectile motion simulation using python. It contains all the documents and codes throughout the development of the simultion.

The projects consists of 3 phases. Each phase repeats the same process that includes planning, trialing of components (feedback), development of the program, testing, and evaluation.

Each sprint will focus on the development of a different component of the program. The focuses of each sprint are as follows:

Sprint 1:

    Development of the main menu
    Development of the simulation description page

Sprint 2:

    Development of value input for simulation parameters
    Development of graphical representation of projectile motion using Matplotlib

Sprint 3 (final):

    Development of displaying projectile motion statistics, including:
        - Total flight time
        - Maximum height
        - Horizontal range
    Development of exporting motion data and statistics as a text file
