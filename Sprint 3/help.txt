ðŸš€ Projectile Motion Simulation - Help ðŸ“š

Welcome to the Projectile Motion Simulation Help page!
Here, you'll find useful information about the simulation and how to use the program effectively.

1. What is Projectile Motion?
   - Projectile motion is the motion of an object projected into the air, subject to the forces of gravity.
   - The object follows a curved path known as a trajectory.

2. How to Run the Simulation:
   - To start the simulation, select option 1 from the main menu.
   - You will be prompted to set the parameters which are angle of projection, initial velocity, and gravitational acceleration.
   - After running the simulation the graph alongside the data of the motion will be displayed.
   - The graph displays the projectile's path over time and provides a visual representation of its motion.
   - The data includes time, horizontal position, vertical position, and velocity components at various time intervals.

6. Important Notes:
   - The simulation assumes no air resistance (i.e. no friction).
   - The vertical displacement formula accounts for gravity's effect on the projectile's motion.
   - Negative vertical displacement indicates the object is below its initial height.

7. Units:
   - Angle: Degrees
   - Velocity: Meters per second (m/s)
   - Gravitational Acceleration: Meters per second squared (m/sÂ²)

Enjoy exploring the motion of trajectories! ðŸš€
