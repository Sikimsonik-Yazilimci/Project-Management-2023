Sprint 3 was focused on developing the final components of the program. This inlcuded the displaying of motion statistics, as well as exporting of the projectile motion data.

THe exporting of data was the component that was trialed in this sprint. Multiple approaches on the structure of the export file(s) were constructed and presented to the testers. Feedback was collected on the aesthetics and functionality of components, with them choosing a final option they would prefer to be implemented in the program.

The program was tested thoroughly to ensure that it is robust.
