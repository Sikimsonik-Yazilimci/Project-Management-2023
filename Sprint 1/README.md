Sprint 1 was focused on developing the base of the program. This included the main menu and the help page.

The main menu was the central component that was trialed. Multiple approaches were constructed and presented to the testers. Feedback was collected on the aesthetics and functionality of components, with them choosing a final option they would prefer to be implemented in the program.

The program was tested thoroughly to ensure that it is robust.
